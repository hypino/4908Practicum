SensorDataCollector Thread:

    initialize sendbuffer
    take reference to sensor list
    create local Unix socket for IPC
    try to remove local socket if it already exists
    bind local socket
    listen for 1 client
    accept the client
    run the main thread loop

    forever:
	select (poll on all sensors for data)
	for each sensor that is active with data
	    getSensorData
        append all data to database
        for each sensor that disconnected
	    close socket
	    remove socket from sensor list
	clear buffers and lists

getSensorData:

    get the sensor serial number
    recv 70 bytes from sensor (size of packet)
    append 70 bytes to sensor serial number
    if recv returned no data, put sensor in a list to be closed later
    put data into the sendbuffer

appendToDatabase:
    for each line in the data
	create a new table row
	append to main database
